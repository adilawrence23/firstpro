<h1 id="main-heading"> Why Recycle ? </h1>
<section>
<p style="font-size:1.2rem;">Recycling is very important as waste has a huge negative impact on the natural environment. Harmful chemicals and greenhouse gasses are released from rubbish in landfill sites. Recycling helps to reduce the pollution caused by waste. The amount of rubbish we create is constantly increasing because people are buying more products and ultimately creating more waste.<span class="special-words"> New technological products are being developed, much of these products contain materials that are not biodegradable.</span> Recycling is one of the best ways to create a positive impact on the world in which we live.</p> 
<div class="group">
